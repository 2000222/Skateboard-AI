## :purple_heart: SkateboardAI: The Coolest Video Action Recognition for Skateboarding.
:notes: This project and paper has been presented at CVPR 2022 WiCV Workshop and will be published by AAAI 2023 Student Abstract and Poster Program. 
### ü§© Abstract :
Impressed by the coolest skateboarding sports program from 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, we are the first to curate the original real-world video datasets ‚ÄúSkateboardAI‚Äù in the wild, even self-design and implement diverse uni-modal and multi-modal video action recognition approaches to recognize different tricks accurately. For uni-modal methods, we separately apply (1) CNN and LSTM; (2) CNN and BiLSTM; (3) CNN and BiLSTM with effective attention mechanisms; (4) Transformer-based action recognition pipeline. Transferred to the multi-modal conditions, we investigated the two-stream Inflated-3D architecture on ‚ÄúSkateboardAI‚Äù datasets to compare its performance with uni-modal cases. In sum, our objective is developing an excellent AI sports referee for the coolest skateboarding competitions.
